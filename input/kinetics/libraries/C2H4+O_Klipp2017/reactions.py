The reaction of atomic oxygen with ethylene is a fundamental oxidation step in combustion.

Decomposition of the initial adduct via spin-allowed reaction channels on the triplet surface competes
with intersystem crossing (ISC) and a set of spin-forbidden reaction channels on the ground-state singlet
surface. This library describes product branching ratios based on the following publication:

X. Li, A.W. Jasper, J. Zxdor, J.A. Miller, S.J. Klippenstein,
Theoretical kinetics of O + C2H4,
Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 36 (2017) 219x227
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proci.2016.06.053

Several different methods were used:
CCSDT(Q)/cc-pVDZ//CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ
For barrierless reactions on the spin allowed surface CASPT2(2e,2o)/cc-pVTZ was used.
For reaction with barriers on the spin allowed surface CCSD(T)/CBS//B2PLYPD3/cc-pVTZ was used.
The total ISC rate was calculated using LandauxZener statistical theory
non-statistical xpromptx branching in the dynamics immediately following ISC was predicted using
direct classical trajectories and the CASPT2(2e,2o)/cc-pVDZ surface.

Pressure dependence in the product branching fractions and the potential formation of stabilized products were
considered, but results show that rates are pressure-independent (with < 10% variations in the branching fractions)
up to 20 bar at 300 K and up to 200 bar at 1000 K.

Channels which account for less than 1% of the products are given in this library a low rate: 1e7 cm^3/(mol*s)
(since reactions 1a, 1b, 1c, 1e, 1f are all in the 1e10-1e13 cm^3/(mol*s) range at the 300-2500 K range)

The manuscript mentioned an additional reaction e' which wasn't included in this library, C2H4 + O <=> CH2(S) + CH2O,
since its rate wasn't discussed.
